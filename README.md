                                               <--Javascript homework assignment-->
  
  
  I created this for my week 3 homework assignment at the UofA coding bootcamp. If I had more time to invest/had the skills, I would have 
  liked to added the following:
  
  A.) Custom sounds for right/wrong guesses. I didn't have the time to sample short enough audio clips using "Pokemon" noises.
  B.) A dynamic background that would change based on the word being displayed from the array, thus giving users a "hint".
  C.) Mobile Responsiveness
  D.) A high score keeper, that would track the players who actually guess all 151 correctly.
  E.) More user interactivity - something that would make the game more engaging and fun. (special fonts, unique noise sounds to each pokemon
      correctly guessed, pop ups with rewards/facts unique to the pokemon guessed, unique rewards that happen at 10/20/30/".." for the user.)
